Customers are segmented according to their similarities in behavior and habits.In this project my team and I implemented two unsupervised machine learning algorithms: K-means, RDF .. . In collaboration with a online retail. Our goal is to segment their customers given the customerâ€™s various behaviors and features, in order for the company to be able to market for each segment in a manner that is more fitting to each individual customer."
